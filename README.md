Block chain
        block chain is a decentralized database. two types of blockchain 1-public blockchain and 2-private blockchain
        public block chain-every one can access the data base and view the data base is called public blockchain
        private block chain only group of peple can access the blockchain
        
block
         every records is strored in public ledger linked one by one using cryptographic technologies
         every block have a two field one is cyptographic hash key and timestamp its used to secure purpose

developer
          santoshi nakamoto introduce blockchain in 1991 and introduce first cryptocurrency bitcoin public ledger transaction in      2008
          
various algorithm 
             proof of work and proof of stack,proof of space etc..
proof of stack
              ethirum switch to algorithm proof of work to proof of stack
              proof of work is participants called like minors
              proof of stack is participants called like validator
              proof of work is 51% strategey used 51% validation is once done its used to deployment
              proof of stack which person have a large money that person validate the blockchain
              proof of stack is better and fast efficient compare to proof of work
Etherium blockchain
               etherium is a  open-source public block-chain project developed vitalik bluetrin
               proof of work
Tezos 
                tezos is blockchain project its self-amending and governance blockchain proof of stack based decentralize     blockchain
